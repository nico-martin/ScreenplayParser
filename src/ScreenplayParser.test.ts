     FADE IN

     EXT. VAN DECKER AUCTION HOUSE - DAY - ON K.I.T.T.

     turning into the parking lot.  Lots of expensive cars.

                               MICHAEL'S VOICE
               Between you and me, Bonnie....

     INT. K.I.T.T. - DAY

     Bonnie is seated next to Michael as he continues:

                               MICHAEL
               I can think of at least ten 
               different ways I'd rather be 
               spending my day off.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE YOUNG LADY

     as Michael spots her.  She's beautiful and wears shorts 
     and T-shirt.

                               MICHAEL
               Make that eleven.

     He pulls into a parking spot.  Bonnie suppresses a smile.

                               BONNIE
               Poor Michael Knight.  Victim of the 
               work ethic.  Prince of the 
               powerless.

                               MICHAEL
               I wouldn't go that far.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Neither would I.

     They get out, start for the entrance.

                               BONNIE
               According to Devon, the late 
               Mrs. Potts was a staunch supporter 
               of the Foundation.

                               MICHAEL
               From the looks of these cars,
               staunch isn't all she was.  She 
               must've been worth millions....

     OMITTED

     INT. VAN DECKER AUCTIONEERS - DAY - CLOSE ON DEVON

                               DEVON
               Ten million, to be precise.

     FULLER ANGLE

     Suitably impressed, Michael and Bonnie are with Devon, while
     in the b.g. a half-dozen or so wealthy buyers inspect the 
     various objects d'art about to be auctioned off.  A nearby
     sign reads:  ESTATE OF THE LATE EUDORA POTTS.  SALE TIME,
     10 AM.

                               DEVON
               Mrs. Potts might've seemed a bit 
               eccentric, Michael, but she had 
               impeccable taste in husbands.

                               MICHAEL
                      (looking off)
               She didn't do too badly in diamonds,
               either.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE JODY TOMPKINS

     She's twenty-three, very pretty, with a great body and a 
     look that tells us she sometimes dreams of far away wonders.
     She's also moving about modeling a million bucks worth of 
     diamond jewelry.  Devon motions to her:

                               DEVON
               The auctioneer said the stones alone
               should fetch about three million --
               the proceeds of which have been 
               earmarked to help fund our various 
               charities.
                      (a little 
                       smile to Jody)
               Now you see why I wanted the two of 
               you here.

                               BONNIE
               I smell public relations.

                               DEVON
               It's not an altogether unpleasant 
               odor.  Sometimes an ounce of PR is 
               worth a pound of arm-twisting.

                               MICHAEL
                      (glances off)
               Speaking of which, I think I see
               someone with a corporate check book
               looking to buy a small present for 
               his wife.

                               DEVON
                      (looks off)
               Very good.  You're learning.  Excuse
               me.

     Devon heads for a gentleman looking at a display case of 
     diamond jewelry.  Bonnie glances at Michael.

                               BONNIE
               With a little practice, you could be
               dangerous.

                               MICHAEL
               Have I told you it's good to have you 
               back?

     She smiles, not sure whether to believe him or not.

                                              CUT TO

     EXT. VAN DECKER AUCTIONEERS - DAY

     We're on Charley Winters and Lyle Austin as they look at the
     jewelry displayed in the small security window.  Winters is
     early thirties, blond and broad-shouldered, with an easy 
     charm and the good looks of an All-American.  Austin, on the 
     other hand, is tough with the personality of a switchblade
     and a face that's run into too many hard objects.  A small 
     sign in the window reads:  ESTATE SALE OF EUDORA POTTS.

                               AUSTIN
               Come on, let's do it.

     He starts toward the front door, but Winters takes his arm,
     cautioning him:

                               WINTERS
               Just remember, we do it clean.

     Austin shrugs off his hand, fits a Halloween mask into 
     place.

                               AUSTIN
               What is this, a stick up or a 
               political campaign?

                               WINTERS
               It's what I say it is, Lyle.  I 
               planned it.  It's my dance.

     INT. VAN DECKER AUCTIONEERS - DAY

     Jody is showing her diamond necklace to Michael and Bonnie,
     unaware they're not potential buyers.  She has a lovely,
     ingenious quality.

                               JODY
               I was told Napoleon gave this to 
               Josephine.

                               BONNIE
               Some men know how to treat women,
               Michael.

                               MICHAEL
               Yes, but you know what happened to 
               Napoleon?

     Michael grins.  Suddenly:

     ANGLE ON WINTERS AND AUSTIN

     bursting into the room.  They wear Halloween masks and hold
     guns, Austin a Magnum and Winters a .38.

                               AUSTIN
               Freeze!  Nobody move!

     ON SECURITY GUARD

     starting to go for his gun when Austin turns on him; feet 
     planted, ready to fire.

                               AUSTIN
               Don't.

     The guard freezes.

                               AUSTIN
               Drop your belt.
                      (to Winters)
               Go!

     ANGLE ON MICHAEL AND DEVON

     exchanging looks but there's little they can do as the guard
     unbuckles his belt.  For all his aplomb, guise of decorum --
     even in a robbery -- Devon seems particularly disturbed.

     FULLER ANGLE

     Winters reaches the display case, smashes it open with his 
     .38.  He scoops out diamond jewelry into a nylon bag.

     Austin grabs the necklace around Jody's neck, looks at her
     close, his eyes to hers.

                               AUSTIN
               You come with this, pretty?

     Michael reacts, angrily.  His eyes are intense, his voice is
     deceptively calm.

                               MICHAEL
               You came for the diamonds.  Take the 
               diamonds.

     Austin reacts, swings the Magnum directly on Michael.

                               AUSTIN
               The only thing standing between you 
               and that wall is my finger.  Don't
               press your luck.

     He yanks the necklace off as Winters crosses back, the
     nylon bag filled.  Austin gives Winters the jewelry he took
     from Jody.  Devon, increasingly distressed, angry, steps 
     forward.

                               DEVON
               Just one damn moment!

     They're so surprised they stop.  Michael and Bonnie stare
     at Devon.

                               DEVON
               Those jewels are the property of the
               Foundation for Law and Government.
               The funds they bring are pledged to 
               charity....

                               AUSTIN
                      (furious)
               Tell me about it!

     Before Devon can respond, or Michael react, Austin hits 
     Devon across the head with his pistol.  Devon is knocked 
     back.  Michael instinctively starts for Austin but Austin
     levels the Magnum at him.

                               AUSTIN
               Like I said, don't press your luck.

     EXT. VAN DECKER - DAY

     The door bursts open and Winter and Austin sprint to two 
     high-powered Japanese bikes at the curb, pulling off their
     masks.

     ANGLE INSIDE VAN DECKERS

     Michael and Bonnie kneel over Devon, semiconscious on the 
     floor.  People mill about, frightened.

                               MICHAEL
                      (comlink)
               Kitt, meet me out front!
                      (to Bonnie)
               Is he okay?

                               BONNIE
               Yes!  Go!

     He goes, dodging through people.  Jody watches like a child
     watching a scary movie.

     OUTSIDE VAN DECKER'S

     Winters and Austin scream away as Michael bursts out,
     running for the curb.

     ANOTHER ANGLE 

     K.I.T.T. materializes around the corner from the parking 
     lot, barrels to a stop at the curb as Michael races to meet
     him, slides in one fluid motion.

     ANGLE ON BYSTANDER

     He stares.

     VARIOUS ANGLES

     Michael hits the throttle...tires spin...the sleek line of 
     K.I.T.T.'s front end flashes by, coming off the curb in an 
     explosion of movement.

     ANGLE IN K.I.T.T.

     Michael is intense behind the wheel.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Michael, what happened?

                               MICHAEL
                      (tight)
               He hit Devon.

                               K.I.T.T.
                      (concerned)
               Who hit Devon?

                               MICHAEL
               One of those guys on the bikes.
                      (angry)
               They had what they wanted.  They 
               didn't have to hit him....

     He shoots past a car, takes a corner on two wheels.

     VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE

     Winters in the lead, the bikes weave easily in and out of 
     traffic.  K.I.T.T., on the other hand, is having his problems
     finding and holding an opening.

     OMITTED

     ON WINTERS AND AUSTIN

     turning onto a street leading to the large drainage pipes of 
     the L.A. River.

     ON K.I.T.T.

     making the same turn but a good distance behind, accelerating.

     EXT. L.A. RIVER (DRY) - DAY - WINTERS AND AUSTIN

     riding down the side walls then racing toward a distant 
     pipe.

     ON K.I.T.T.

     roaring down the side wall after them.

     INT. K.I.T.T. - DAY

     The speedometer reads 120.  Shooting from behind Michael,
     through the windshield, we see him gaining on the bikers.

     EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAY

     Winters and Austin head directly for the mouth of the pipe.
     Then, just before reaching it, they bend forward so that 
     their chins hit the handlebars, and disappear into the dark
     tunnel with only inches to spare.

     INT. K.I.T.T. - DAY

     Michael sees the pipe coming up fast.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Michael, unless you're planning on 
               changing my design, and yours, there's
               absolutely no way I can squeeze into 
               that pipe.

     Frustrated, Michael slams on the brakes.  Shooting:

     MICHAEL'S POINT OF VIEW

     We see the pipe coming up to within a few feet.

     WIDER ANGLE

     as he screeches to a stop just inches from the opening.
     Michael jumps out, looking over the area.

                               MICHAEL
               Kitt, scan the drainage system!  They 
               have to come out somewhere.

     INSERT - K.I.T.T.'S MONITOR

     to see a hologram of the drainage system, a maze of inter-
     locking pipes.

     BACK TO SCENE

     as Michael slides back in:

                               K.I.T.T.
               That's true, Michael.  But right now 
               they have their choice of twenty-five
               exits, covering an area of over a 
               hundred miles.

     Michael's face registers disappointment, frustration.

                               MICHAEL
               I want those guys, Kitt.  Whatever 
               it takes, I want 'em.

     He hits the throttle and K.I.T.T. fishtails away.

     EXT. HILLCREST CANYON - DAY - ON WINTERS AND AUSTIN

     as they emerge on their bikes from a drainage pipe located
     in an isolated rocky area.  They pull to a stop.

                               AUSTIN
               We did it!  Didn't I tell you to 
               listen to the old pro?

                               WINTERS
               You sure did, Lyle.

     They remove their dark Plexiglas helmets, climb off the 
     bikes, dusty but exhilarated.

                               AUSTIN
               Now, you want my advice, you come to 
               Napa with me and have that doc fix 
               you up.  Time he's through no one'll
               ever know who you are.

                               WINTERS
                      (weighs his 
                       words a beat)
               But no one knows who I am now.
               You're the one with the record,
               Lyle, the one who's wanted for
               breaking his parole.  There's no 
               one on earth looking for me.

                               AUSTIN
               All I'm saying is, you can't be too
               careful.  Just when you least expect
               it some punk always pops out of the 
               woodwork and points a finger at you.
                      (rubs hands 
                       together)
               Okay, let's divvy it up.

     Winters looks at him a beat, nods:

                               WINTERS
               Sure.

     He goes to his saddlebag, but instead of pulling out the 
     diamonds he takes out his gun, aims it at Austin.

                               AUSTIN
               Hey, is this a joke?  What d'ya
               think you're doin'?

                               WINTERS
               Just listening to the old pro, Lyle
               ...eliminating the only punk who 
               could ever point a finger at me.

     Austin bolts, running for the drainage pipe.

     ANGLE ON WINTERS

     He raises the .38, aims and fires.

     K.I.T.T. is parked outside.

     INT. LOFT/APARTMENT - DAY - ON MICHAEL

     as he looks at a large canvas covered entirely with streaks
     of paint, a la Jackson Pollock, trying to figure out what it 
     is, or isn't.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE JODY

     standing next to him.  She wears paint-spattered jeans and 
     top.  There are other paintings of equal quality about the 
     large room which also serves both as her studio and her 
     apartment.

                               JODY
               As you can see modeling is just a 
               means to an end.  I'm really an 
               artist.  Recognize it?

               Of course...I mean...what else could
               it be?  Have you been painting long?

               learn to scuba dive.  To be truthful,
               it began as a matter of survival....

                               MICHAEL
               Good thinking.

                               JODY
               Then it began to grow...and grow...
               until it's what you see today.  Are 
               you interested in neo-expressionism?

                               MICHAEL
               Isn't everyone?  But right now I'm 
               interested in that robbery at the 
               auction this morning.

                               JODY
               I already told the police everything 
               I know, which is nothing.  I was 
               just hired to model some jewelry,
               that's all.

                               MICHAEL
               I was hoping you might have seen 
               something...anything no matter how 
               small or insignificant.

                               JODY
                      (shakes 
                       her head)
               Look, I'm sorry your Foundation lost
               those diamonds.  I know the money was 
               going to a good cause.  But the only 
               thing I remember about this morning 
               is that I was scared to death.

                               MICHAEL
               I don't blame you.  Well, thanks for 
               your time.
                      (hands her card)
               If anything comes to mind you can 
               reach me here.

     entering the front door.  He's dressed in a tasteful sport
     shirt and jacket, tailored pants and carries a briefcase.
     He could be your average businessman.  He stops upon seeing
     Michael, but Jody runs to him.

     They embrace, then Jody sees him glancing at Michael.

               Oh, I'm sorry.  Charley, this is

                               WINTERS
               Jody told me about the robbery.
               Incredible.  Any leads?

                               MICHAEL
               Nothing yet.

     Over this the phone rings.  Jody answers it.

                               JODY
               Hello...yes, just a minute.
                      (to Michael)
               It's for you.

     Michael takes the phone.

               Michael, the police just turned up 
               something very interesting....

     ON MICHAEL

     Jody hugs Charley, relieved he's here.  Charley watches 
     Michael.

                               MICHAEL
                      (listens a beat)
               I'll get right out there.  Thanks.
                      (hangs up)
               Looks like we've got ourselves a 
               lead after all.

     Winters fights down a reaction.

                               WINTERS
               That was fast.  Anything you can 
               share?

                               MICHAEL
               A kid found an abandoned bike in the 
               Hillcrest Canyon area and called the 
               police.  They speculate a falling 
               out among thieves.
                      (heads for door)
               Thanks for your help.

                               WINTERS
               'Speculate?'

                               MICHAEL
               They found blood...but no body.

     Michael leaves closing the door behind him.  Winters looks 
     shaken.

                               JODY
               You have no idea how awful it was.

                               WINTERS
               I can imagine.

     He crosses to the window, thinking furiously.

                               WINTERS
               I wish I didn't have to leave so soon.

                               JODY
               Leave?  What are you talking about?

                               WINTERS
               Remember that real estate deal I 
               told you about?  It's gonna close 
               faster than I thought.

                               JODY
               What real estate deal?  Charley, I 
               don't want to be alone.  Not now.
               I'll come with you.

                               WINTERS
               Honey, this is business.

                               JODY
               I don't care.  You won't even know 
               I'm there.
                      (teasing smile)
               Unless you want to.  Where are we 
               going?

               Michael, you know how I feel about 
               dogs, but perhaps this is one job 
               better suited for a bloodhound.

               I have complete faith in you, pal.
               Besides, the Sheriff's Department 
               can't have their dogs up here for 
               another hour yet.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Somehow, Michael, I don't look upon
               that as a compliment.

     Suddenly a beeping sound.  Michael looks toward the monitor.

               This is as far as we go.  I'll have 
               to make the rest of the way on foot.

     Michael stops.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Be careful, Michael, there's nothing 
               more dangerous than a wounded animal.

     Michael gets out.

     EXT. RUGGED TERRAIN - DAY

     Michael looks around, then heads up the rocky hillside.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as Michael climbs upward out of K.I.T.T.'s scanning vision:

     ANGLE ON AUSTIN

     hiding behind some large rocks directly above Michael's 
     path.  He's wounded, desperate, but still strong enough to 
     fight for his life.

     ON MICHAEL

     as he climbs directly beneath Austin.

     pushing a large rock down with his feet.

     hearing the sound of the falling rock, looking up.

     MICHAEL'S POINT OF VIEW - THE FALLING ROCK

     Michael dives out of the way, somersaults, barely avoids
     being crushed to death by the falling rock, then gets to 
     his feet to see:

     taking a wild shot at Michael, then heading for higher 
     ground.

     BACK ON MICHAEL

     going after him.

     VARIOUS ANGLES OF CHASE

     as Michael scampers up the hill, avoiding the falling rocks
     created by Austin's flight, and coming up behind him.

     FAVORING AUSTIN

     spinning about to take a shot.  But before he squeezes the 
     trigger:

     FAVORING MICHAEL

     knocks the gun from his hand, leaving Austin wide open, and 
     smashing him into the hillside.  As Austin slips unconsciously
     to the ground, Michael's comlink beeps, followed by:

                               K.I.T.T.'S VOICE

     paramedic.  Two L.A. police cars are in evidence, with 
     several police officers present, and an ambulance.

                               MICHAEL
               Why are you protecting him?

                               AUSTIN
               Because I'm a nice guy.

                               MICHAEL
               You're not a nice guy, you're a 
               dirtbag.  Now who's your partner,
               Lyle?  What's his name?

                               AUSTIN
               I don't know what you're talking 
               about.  It was a hunting accident.
               Someone mistook me for a deer.

                               MICHAEL
               A jackass would be more like it.
               Well, suit yourself.  But I guess 
               you won't be going on that little 
               trip you had planned.

                               AUSTIN
               What trip is that?

                               MICHAEL
               To Napa.  The police found this 
               airline ticket tucked away in your 
               saddlebag.  Was your partner going 
               with you?

                               AUSTIN
               Anyone ever tell you you have a one-
               track mind?

                               MICHAEL
               All the time.  That's why I usually 
               get what I go after.

               A good question, Michael.  He 
               doesn't exactly seem like a

                               MICHAEL
               Let's see if we can give him a hand.

     EXT. GULLY - DAY - ON OVERTURNED WAGON

     The monk, Brother Francis, short and round and loveable --
     wearing his familiar cassock -- is huffing and puffing in a 
     vain attempt to right his old wooden wagon that was loaded 
     with used clothing, etc., for the poor.

     While a short distance away, in the comfort of a shade 
     tree, sits Brother Tyrone, tall and thin and sullen, and 
     next to him, the monastery donkey, also sitting.  Pulling a
     wagon is one thing, righting it another.  Suddenly their 
     attention, including the donkey's, shift up the road.

     WHAT THEY SEE - K.I.T.T.

     racing to the rescue, down the embankment leading into the 
     gully, along the bumpy gully, and pulling up nearby.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Even Brother Tyrone is almost impressed with K.I.T.T.'s 
     driving performance.  Michael gets out, moves to them ---

                               MICHAEL
               Looks like you can use some help.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Yes, we were delivering food and 
               clothes to the poor when I'm afraid 
               we strayed a little too far from 
               the straight and narrow.  I'm Brother 
               Francis....

                               MICHAEL
               Michael Knight....

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               And that's Brother Tyrone.

                               MICHAEL
                      (to Tyrone)
               Nice meeting you.

     But Brother Tyrone doesn't respond.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               You'll have to forgive him.  He's 
               taken a vow of silence.  Unfortunately
               ...he could never work without talking.

                               MICHAEL
               I know how that is.

     Michael gives K.I.T.T. a look.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               And that's Kit.

                               MICHAEL
               How did you know?

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
                      (re donkey)
               Oh, but I named him.  When he was 
               just a little ass.

                               MICHAEL
               Your donkey's name is Kit?!

                               K.I.T.T.
               I beg your pardon!

     The donkey brays in outrage.  Even Tyrone comes close to 
     speaking!

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Dear Lord, a talking car!  Will
               miracles never cease?  Or perhaps...
               it's a sign, Brother Tyrone.

     The two Brothers exchange nervous looks, interrupted by:

                               K.I.T.T.
               Michael, I suggest we give them a 
               hand and be on our way.

                               MICHAEL
               Right...Kitt.

     Donkey brays ---

                               K.I.T.T.
               If you don't mind, I believe he's 
               talking to me!

                               MICHAEL
               Let's have the grappling hook.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               And it even drives itself!

                               K.I.T.T.
               Which is more than I can say for big 
               ears over there.

     K.I.T.T. comes over.  Michael takes out the grappling hook,
     hooks it onto the wagon, and reads what's painted on the 
     side:

                               MICHAEL
               'The Monastery of the Grape.'

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
                      (proud)
               Yes, perhaps you've tasted some of 
               our wine.  Monk's Cellar.  We make a 
               perfectly delightful Cabernet, or at 
               least we used to before our wine 
               maker, Brother Juliano....

     He suddenly stops upon receiving a stern look from Brother 
     Tyrone.  A look Michael catches.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Perhaps we will again someday.  The
               good Lord willing.

                               MICHAEL
               I'm sure you will.  Ready, Kitt?

     Donkey brays, and brays and brays.

                               K.I.T.T.
               Something definitely has to be done 
               about this.  Michael, just keep that 
               -- big dog -- away from my tires.

                               MICHAEL
               After we right the wagon, we'll tow 
               it back onto the road.

                               K.I.T.T.
               And the sooner the better.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Bless you...both of you.

     Michael gets in and K.I.T.T. drives to right the wagon.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Brother Tyrone -- I'm sure it's a 
               sign -- Brother Juliano's going to 
               be back with us soon!

     Brother Francis starts retrieving the spilled clothing.
     Tyrone decides to lend a hand.

     EXT. MONK'S CELLAR WINERY - DAY - ESTABLISHING A SMALLER
     MISSION-STYLE WINERY

     Tourists can be seen stopping at the wine tasting bar.  Also 
     a number of monks moving about the extensive grounds.

     OMITTED

     ANGLE ON BROTHER ROME

     Big, mean and hooded, he suddenly stops, turns impatiently ---

                               ROME
               Come on, the doctor's waiting.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHARLEY WINTERS

     who's been glancing about curiously ---

                               WINTERS
               All right, all right.

     He catches up, and they move through a door.

     INT. BOTTLING ROOM - DAY

     Monks are operating the fascinating and complex machinery
     that fills thousands of bottles with wine.  They avoid
     looking at the two men.  Then Rome leads Winters to a wine
     rack that obviously serves another purpose.  He swings the 
     rack out, revealing a steel door.  Takes another key,
     unlocks it, looks to the ever more curious Winters ---

                               ROME
               You first.

                               WINTERS
               Sure, why not?

     INT. DOCTOR FELLOWS' CORRIDOR - DAY - ON WINTERS

     He barely enters, Rome locking the door behind him, before
     he freezes.

     WHAT WINTERS SEES

     a long, wide corridor, with doors on each side leading to 
     various rooms, and bordering some of the doors are racks of
     wine, so that in many ways this area resembles a large wine
     cellar.  But what has made Winters uneasy are the monks 
     moving about.  Unlike the ones we've seen up front, most of 
     these have bandaged faces beneath their cassock hoods.

     ANGLE ON BROTHER JULIANO

     A gentle man of sixty, his pleasant face not bandaged, being
     led to one of the rooms by another unbandaged monk we'll 
     call Carey.  Upon seeing Winters, Brother Juliano stops 
     and gives him a rather stern look before being prodded by 
     Carey:

                               CAREY
               Inside your cage, Brother Juliano!

     Beat, then Brother Juliano gets into his cell and Carey 
     locks the door.

     BACK TO SCENE

                               ROME
               This way.

     Winters hesitates, then follows.

     INT. DOCTOR FELLOWS' OFFICE/OPERATING - DAY

     Winters sits in a treatment chair, in front of a mirror,
     as Dr. Fellows, thirty-seven, pleasant, competent, draws 
     on Winters' face with a colorful skin scribe marking pen.
     A pretty young Nurse, Miss Jones, assists him.  The office
     is very modern.  Rome is also present.

                               FELLOWS
               We'll make the eyes a little rounder
               ...narrow the bridge of your nose...
               raise your cheekbones...and even 
               alter your fingertips.  In time 
               you'll forget there ever was a 
               Charley Winters.  Isn't that right,
               Miss Jones.

                               NURSE
               Charley who?

     Fellows gives a little laugh at her attempt at humor.
     Winters isn't amused.

                               WINTERS
               And how much is this going to cost me?

                               FELLOWS
               I usually charge according to what my 
               patients can afford.  From what I've 
               heard, you can afford quite a bit.

                               WINTERS
               Don't believe everything you hear, I
               had to split fifty-fifty with my 
               partner.

                               FELLOWS
               Your partner was shot under 
               'mysterious' circumstances, and 
               picked up before he got his cut.  
               Which gives you even more reason for 
               wanting to become someone else, in 
               case he ever gets out and comes 
               looking for you.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE ROME

     taking all this in with interest.

                               WINTERS
                      (beat)
               All right, what are we talking about?

                               FELLOWS
               You stole around three million in 
               diamond jewelry.  I like round 
               figures.  Ten percent is a nice 
               round figure.

                               WINTERS
               That's three hundred thousand
               dollars!

                               FELLOWS
               A small price to be born again 
               without having to listen to a lot 
               of sermons.  Of course, that includes
               new ID, passport, credit cards, and 
               all the other little necessities of 
               modern day life.

                               WINTERS
                      (thinks)
               When can we get started?

                               FELLOWS
               I don't take Blue Cross, Charley, but 
               I do take white ice.  You come back 
               here with three hundred thousand in 
               diamonds...and you've got yourself
               a new face.

     Fellows grins, and turns off the bright examination light.

     ANGLE ON ROME

     watching Winters with a very greedy look.

     EXT. RIESLING INN - DAY - ON JODY

     as she immortalizes the picturesque inn, nestled within 
     fields of grapes, on canvas.  Or to be more exact randomly
     spatters the entire canvas with multicolored paint.  Hot
     air balloons are seen drifting in the b.g.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE K.I.T.T.

     gliding up behind her.  Michael gets out, but she's too
     absorbed in her art to hear him.  Michael examines the 
     canvas:

                               MICHAEL
               No, don't tell me....

     She turns, surprised, pleased.

                               MICHAEL
                      (points)
               The Inn!

                               JODY
               You recognize it?

                               MICHAEL
               Are you serious?  Although...I think 
               you left out one of the windows over 
               here.

     He points to the place on the canvas.

                               JODY
               You're right.
                      (splashes on
                       a blotch)
               There!

                               MICHAEL
               You got it!

                               JODY
               Hey, what are you doing here?

                               MICHAEL
               Guess I could ask you the same thing.

                               JODY
               Charley had some business to take 
               care of, so I decided to keep him 
               company.

     She continues to splash on paint, forcing Michael to back 
     off a bit.

                               MICHAEL
               What kind of business is Charley in?

                               JODY
               Real estate.  He works for the 
               Boulder Land Development Company.
               Ever hear of it?

                               MICHAEL
               No, can't say that I have.

                               JODY
               Charley's one of their top men.

                               MICHAEL
               I'm sure he is.
                      (slight beat)

                       laugh)
               We're getting married in a couple of 
               months.

                               MICHAEL
               That's not what I asked.

     Stops painting, looks at him.  This is obviously a sore 
     spot:

                               JODY
               Four weeks, all right?

                               MICHAEL
               Four weeks?

                               JODY
               Charley's a good man and he loves me
               ...and more important, I love him.

     They look at one another a beat, then Jody sees Winters
     driving up and goes to meet him.  He tenses upon seeing 
     Michael.

                               JODY
               Charley, how'd the meeting go?

                               WINTERS
               Fine...just fine.

                               JODY
                      (re Michael)
               Look who's here.

                               WINTERS
               I see.

     Her arm around him as he moves toward Michael.

                               WINTERS
               Anything we can do for you,
               Mr. Knight?

                               MICHAEL
               Nope, just following up on that 
               diamond robbery.

                               WINTERS
               Then in that case I don't think you 
               should be bothering Jody.

                               JODY
               Charley, he was just....

                               WINTERS
                      (interrupting)
               She's been through enough, Mr. Knight.
               What she needs now is a little R and 
               R.
                      (crowding him)
               So if you don't mind....

                      (interrupting)
               Hey, I don't mind one bit.  Besides
               -- Charley -- she's not the one I'm
               interested in...
                      (smiles)
               It's you.

     Dr. Fellows, in operating gear, stands over Winters on the

               One second.

     She shakes out a brush, tries washing her hands.

     Another knock.

                               JODY
               All right, all right.

     She goes to the door wiping paint-smeared hands on her
     T-shirt, opens it.

     taking up most of the doorway.  Her eyes grow wide but she
     tries not to seem afraid.

               Yes....

     Rome pushes his way in.

                               JODY
               Hey, what do you want?

     He slams the door shut after him.

                               ROME
               The diamonds!

                               JODY
               What diamonds?!

                               ROME
               The ones I'm going to retire on.  Now,
               where'd he hide them?!

     He begins pulling drawers out, knocking over lamps, throwing
     off cushions.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as Jody makes a dash for the door.  But before she can 
     reach it, Rome grabs hold of her, begins shaking her:

                               ROME
               I want those diamonds!

     Jody struggles, starts to scream, but Rome covers her mouth
     with his huge hand.

                               MICHAEL
               I hope Jody's alone.  It'll sure 
               make it a whole lot easier telling
               her what we found out about her 
               fiance.

     He gets out.

     EXT. RIESLING ROOM - DAY - ON MICHAEL

     as he climbs the exterior stairs leading to 2A.  Midway up,
     he hears Jody screaming, runs the rest of the way, and kicks 
     the door open.  An inn maid, working nearby, moves closer to
     see what's happening.

     INT. JODY'S ROOM - DAY

     Seeing Michael coming in, Rome draws Jody even closer to 
     him, draws his gun, and holds it on her.  Michael freezes.

                               ROME
               Come any closer and she's dead.

                               MICHAEL
               I hear you.  I hear you.

     Michael backs out the door, to let them pass.  And as they

     Rome moves toward the stairs with Jody.  Michael gives him
     plenty of room.

               Just don't hurt her.
                      (to Jody)
               It's going to be okay.  Just keep 
               cool.

     Rome backs down the stairs with her.

               You drive.

                               JODY
               Yes, but not very well.

                               ROME
               That wasn't a question!  Drive!

     He hustles her behind the wheel, slides in himself, and they 
     roar off.

     jumping into K.I.T.T.

     K.I.T.T. surfaces from the embankment onto the road.

     ON PICKUP

     Rome's rearview is now blocked by the large car trailer.

     The two men exchange hard punches; Michael rolls backwards

     him; Michael rolls; Rome misses.  More punches; Michael's 
     down, and Rome takes off across the grape fields.

     seeing K.I.T.T. bearing down on him, stopping, turning, and
     running right into Michael's fist, which knocks him clean
     back onto K.I.T.T.'s hood.  And out cold.  Michael jumps
     onto the hood next to him, just in case he comes to ---

     Michael, upset, paces in front of the TV monitor, with 
     Rome's picture on it, while Devon stands nearby.  Bonnie
     is putting something into K.I.T.T.'s computer bank.

                               MICHAEL
               Just what we needed -- the man 
               who never was.  Fake IDs, credit
               cards, driver's license, even his 
               fingerprints don't belong to him.

                               DEVON
               He's obviously been given a totally
               new identity.

                               MICHAEL
               The question is, who was he?

               It's obvious our friend here has 
               undergone extensive plastic surgery,
               so I'll simply use the I.G.P. to 
               break down his new face....

     An I.G.P. button lights up on K.I.T.T.'s dash, and the face

               Of course, that goes for you, too,

               The condemned murderer who escaped 
               death row last year.  They've been 
               looking everywhere for him.

                               MICHAEL
               That's it!  If Charley Winters is 
               our man, that's why he's in Napa.
               To buy a new identity.

                               DEVON
               But where does one go to buy such a 
               thing, Michael?

                               MICHAEL
               That's a good question.  When I find 
               out you'll be the first to know.

     He jumps into K.I.T.T.

               Michael, you don't know Charley's a 
               thief!  The police searched this place 
               inside out and couldn't find those
               diamonds!

                               MICHAEL
               Which only means Charley must've taken 
               them with him.  What I do know is,
               Charley isn't who he claims to be.

                               JODY
               What do you mean?

                               MICHAEL
               His real name's James Benson.  Over 
               the years he's called himself Charles
               Samson, Dave Winters, Chuck Bender,
               just to name a few of his aliases.
               Before crashing the big time he was 
               a con man, and there was always a 
               pretty woman involved somewhere.
                      (beat)
               Jody, he's been engaged to three of 
               them.

                               MICHAEL
               I think you do.  You told me yourself
               it was more important to love him 
               than for him to love you.  Maybe you 
               suspected he didn't love you as much
               ...that he was only using you.

                               JODY
               That's a lie!

                               MICHAEL
               Then where is he?

                               JODY
               I told you, he had to go look at 
               some land in Santa Rosa.

               it.

                               MICHAEL
               Maybe he does, Jody...but it's not 
               the kind of love you want or need.
                      (beat)
               You must have some idea where he is.

               What did you do when you got to 
               Napa?

                               JODY
               Checked in here.

                               MICHAEL
               After that?  Think.  It could be 
               important.

                               JODY
               We...went to this winery.

                               MICHAEL
               Which one?

                               MICHAEL
               What did you do there?

                               JODY
               We went to where you taste the wine
               and...Charley did something kinda
               strange.

                               MICHAEL
               What?

                               JODY
               He asked for a glass of Chateau Neuf
               du Pape.

                               MICHAEL
               A French wine in a California winery?

                               JODY
               I told you it was strange.

                               MICHAEL
               Then what happened?

                               JODY
               Charley sent me on the tour...and 
               when I came back he was there
               waiting.

                               MICHAEL
               Thanks, Jody.  You going to be okay?

                               JODY
               What can happen to me with that 
               private security guard you put 
               outside my door?

                               MICHAEL
               Not a thing...which is exactly what 
               I want.

     He smiles, gives her a light kiss on the cheek and leaves.

               It's quite popular these...days.

     Fellows has hesitated upon noticing something.

                               MICHAEL
               Something wrong, Doc?

               I see...you've had extensive plastic

               Yeah...my face became too popular

                               FELLOWS
               Good.
                      (washing hands)

                               FELLOWS
               That's strange.  Because when my
               people checked you out -- they told 
               me it was more like a million five.

                               MICHAEL
               So after the first million, who
               counts?

                               FELLOWS
               I'm glad you feel that way...because 
               I want a hundred and fifty thousand.

     accidentally bumping into Michael, and vice versa.  The 
     monk, wearing a cossack, has a ruggedly handsome face,
     although there's still quite a bit of swelling, and some 
     bluish discoloring highlighted with Vaseline.  Michael 
     apologizes:

               Sorry...brother.

     Michael smiles and hurries off.  But the monk doesn't 
     appear amused.  In fact, he stares after Michael with a 
     hard, angry look until:

               up at the Monastery of the Grape
               with an offer of financial assistance.

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               You see, the Monastery had hit upon 
               hard times.  But we had no idea he 
               was going to use the winery as a 
               front for his -- pardon the pun --
               illegal operations.

                               MICHAEL
               Why didn't you go to the police?

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Because they're holding our wine maker,
               Brother Juliano, hostage.  They said 
               they'd hurt him if we tried to get help.

                               MICHAEL
               Charley...I wish I could say it was 
               an improvement.

     The monks move in.  He struggles, manages to get in a good
     shot or two, but there are just too many.  As they get the 
     best of him he talks to his comlink:

                               MICHAEL
               Kitt, if you don't hear from me in 
               twenty seconds, c'mon in!

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE NURSE

     moving in with a loaded syringe, and giving Michael a shot
     through his pants.  Into comlink, as he falls ---

                               MICHAEL
               Make that ten!

                               FELLOWS
               That shot won't last long.  Get him 
               into surgery.

               Is there another way into Doctor

               Only is you like going through solid
               brick walls.

                               K.I.T.T.
               It's not my favorite pastime, but it 
               sure beats socializing with a donkey!

     K.I.T.T. does a 180, and roars off.

     EXT. REAR OF WINERY - DAY - ON K.I.T.T.

     as he roars across the grape field, scanning various winery 
     walls.

     as a graphic drawing appears showing Dr. Fellows' corridor.

     The Brothers mouth a prayer.

     INT. FELLOWS' OFFICE/SURGERY - DAY

     Michael is beginning to stir.  Fellows is with the Nurse as 
     Winters is putting his diamonds into the bag he used at the 
     robbery and stuffing it into his pocket.

                               FELLOWS
               Let's find out how much this 
               Foundation knows about us.

     The Nurse squirts out the remaining air in her IV, brings 
     the needle to Michael's vein ---

     hitting the bricks ---

     INT. K.I.T.T. - DAY

     Tyrone feels it's time to break his vow of silence:

                               BROTHER TYRONE
               Glory, glory hallelujah!

                               BROTHER FRANCIS
               Now that's how to break a vow of 
               silence!

     INT. DR. FELLOWS' CORRIDOR - DAY - ON K.I.T.T.

     exploding right through a rack of wine which was up against 
     the corridor wall.  The monks scatter as the bottles break,
     some of them exploding red wine.

     INT. FELLOWS' OFFICE/SURGERY - DAY

     Fellows, Winters and the Nurse react.

                               FELLOWS
               What was that?!

     They go to find out.

     INT. FELLOWS' CORRIDOR - DAY

     Fellows, et al see K.I.T.T. searching for Michael, the monks 
     in mass confusion.  Fellows heads back for his office.

     ON K.I.T.T.

     His scanner searching, calling out ---

                               K.I.T.T.
               Michael!  Michael!

     INT. FELLOWS' OFFICE/SURGERY - DAY - ON MICHAEL

     still wobbly, he gets up just as Fellows enters the room
     -- and decks the Doc with one punch.

     INT. FELLOWS' CORRIDOR - DAY - ON MICHAEL

     hurrying to Brother Juliano's cell, taking out one of his 
     tools, picking the lock and freeing the wine maker.

                               BROTHER JULIANO
               God bless you!

     K.I.T.T. pulls up.

                               MICHAEL
               Kitt, have Devon call in the police.

     Brother Juliano squeezes into the back of the Trans Am.

     CLOSE ON MICHAEL

     looking about.

     MICHAEL'S POINT OF VIEW - WINTERS

     running for the exit door.

     BACK TO SCENE

               Meet me outside, pal!

               Right!

     K.I.T.T. backs out the same hole he came in, as Michael 
     takes off after Winters.

     turning, pushing over a case of bottles to slow Michael up,
     and continuing on.

     following Winters from the bottling room.

     EXT. SIDE OF WINERY - DAY

     Winters races to a winery four-wheeler, gets in and takes 
     off.

     ON MICHAEL

     coming out as K.I.T.T. pulls up.  The Brothers pile out.
     To Michael:

                               BROTHER JULIANO
               Nothing succeeds like faith, love 
               and charity...Now go, young man, and 
               waste him!

                               MICHAEL
               Gotcha!

     Michael gets in, and they go after Winters.

     VARIOUS ANGLES OF CHASE

     Winters has a good head start, but K.I.T.T. is gaining.

     CLOSE ON WINTERS

     seeing something up ahead and reacting.

     WHAT HE SEES - SEVERAL HOT AIR BALLOONS

     preparing to take off.

     BACK TO SCENE

     as Winters turns off the road and races for the balloons.

     ON K.I.T.T.

     taking the turn off the road.

     ON WINTERS

     pulling up near a balloon, getting out, and running to the
     gondola, which happens to be occupied by a young man.

                               WINTERS
               I'll say a prayer for you!

     Winters tosses the already petrified young man out, climbs 
     aboard, and takes off.

     ANGLE ON K.I.T.T.

     racing full throttle toward the balloon and screeching to 
     a stop.

                               MICHAEL
               Let's go fishing, Kitt.

                               MICHAEL
               You bet we did, buddy.  Let's reel
               it in.

     K.I.T.T. reels the balloon back to earth as Michael races 
     toward it.

     ANGLE ON BALLOON

     as Michael reaches inside, pulls Winters out, and after a 
     brief struggle knocks him unconscious.  He takes the bag 
     of diamonds from his pocket:

               Get Devon, Kitt...

               Sure you won't have some wine, Kitt?

                               K.I.T.T.
               I don't need artificial stimulants 
               to make me feel good, Devon.

                               DEVON
               Suit yourself.  Cheers.

     They drink.  Brother Tyrone clears his throat.  Silence.

                               BROTHER TYRONE
               As you know, I'm not much of a speech
               maker... just thank you for your help
               and God bless you.

     Some applause.

                               BONNIE
               That was a beautiful speech, Brother
               Tyrone.

               Jody, I've got some good news for 
               you.  Devon has agreed to buy a 
               couple of your paintings.  Isn't 
               that right, Devon?

                               DEVON
                      (caught off
                       guard)
               Agreed?  Insisted is more like it!

                      (to Michael)
               Thanks.  And to show you my appre-
               ciation I painted your portrait.

     She reaches for a nearby canvas.

                               MICHAEL
               I...can hardly wait to see it.

                               JODY
               Well?  What do you think?

     Michael is stunned by what he sees.

                               JODY
               I also painted one of Kitt.

     She gets it.
